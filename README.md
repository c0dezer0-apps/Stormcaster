# Stormcaster

## The problem

A lot of the best weather apps are bought up or merge with bigger companies. Often times this means that the features
that users love go bye-bye, or become inaccessible due to increase in price of paid services beyond what a user is
comfortable paying. And sometimes they become entirely inaccessible on certain platforms because of transitioning to new
platforms (cough, Dark Sky, cough).

## The solution

Introducing Stormcaster, a hyperlocal weather app that displays all the data you'll ever need and want on weather, in a
clean and understandable format. And for a personal touch, each forecast comes with a message, usually sarcastic in
nature, either from the database or through a couple API's, customizable in user settings.
